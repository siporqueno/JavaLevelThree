I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill
[Chorus]
Cause if you want to run cool
If you want to run cool
If you want to run cool, you got to run
On heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
